What Cosco does:

Appends, substitutes or removes a comma or a semi-colon to the end of your line, based on its context.

It:

Takes into consideration previous and next lines endings, as well line indentations.
Ignores blank lines.
Will maintain your cursor's original position.
The best way to describe it is with examples -- take a look at the official page on GitHub to see examples.

For examples, installation and usage, see the documentation at:
